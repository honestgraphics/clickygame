## Background
This app is called Audition and it was done as part of Project 3 for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp.

This app lets you listen to songs to make sure that you are ready to play them live. Add the necessary data about the songs for keeping track of what is played. Submit for Manager Approval. Then add to the Database if everything is correct.

## How to get started with the app
The application is online at [Heroku](Heroku link will be here). You will more than likely have to wait a little while after visiting this url before Heroku spins up the virtual machine which hosts the project.

Please install Git Bash, Robo 3T, and Node.js if you want to use the app locally. 

After all of these are installed, download the Audition Github Repo.


Next install the project dependencies by entering:

  yarn install


The project is now ready to run!

Start the server by typing in:

    yarn run dev
    
      OR
    
    node server.js

Open a browser and navigate to:

  http://localhost:3000/ 

in the address line.
