## Background
This app is called Clicky Game and it was done as part of React HW #1 for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp.

This app lets you try to choose a character without choosing the same one twice. After each choice the character cards are shuffled and then you get to choose again. If you choose a character that you previously chose, you have to start over. If your score is higher than it previously was, then the new score is entered into high score in the nav bar.

## How to get started with the app
The application is online at [Heroku](https://morning-reef-70840.herokuapp.com/). You will more than likely have to wait a little while after visiting this url before Heroku spins up the virtual machine which hosts the project.

Please install Git Bash and Node.js if you want to use the app locally. 

After all of these are installed, download the Clicky Game Github Repo.


Next install the project dependencies by entering:

  yarn install


The project is now ready to run!

Start the server by typing in:

    yarn start
    
      OR
    
    node server.js

Open a browser and navigate to:

  http://localhost:3000/ 

in the address line.
